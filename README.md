# Sales Insights Dashboard

## Overview
This project involves creating a comprehensive sales insights dashboard using the **Indian `db_dumb` dataset**. The objective is to extract valuable insights from sales data through data preprocessing, transformation, and visualization. The workflow combines the power of **MySQL Workbench** for data preparation and relationship management, and **Power BI** for creating an interactive and insightful dashboard.

## Features

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Cleaned and prepared the dataset using SQL to ensure data quality.
   - Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized data formats.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Established relationships between tables in MySQL.
   - Filtered data and performed transformations to make it suitable for analysis.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Built an interactive dashboard in Power BI.
   - Included key sales metrics and trends for better understanding and actionable insights.

## Tools Used

- **MySQL Workbench**:
  - For data preparation, relationship creation, and SQL-based transformations.

- **Power BI**:
  - For data visualization and building the interactive dashboard.

## Key Insights

- **Sales Trends Over Time**:
  - Visualized sales growth patterns and seasonal fluctuations.

- **Product and Category Performance**:
  - Identified top-performing products and categories.

- **Regional Sales Analysis**:
  - Analyzed regional sales performance to pinpoint high and low-performing areas.

- **Customer Segmentation and Purchasing Patterns**:
